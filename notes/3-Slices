Another data type that does not have ownership is the slice. 
Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.

    let s = String::from("hello world");

    let hello = &s[0..5];
    let world = &s[6..11];
This is similar to taking a reference to the whole String but with the extra [0..5] bit. 
Rather than a reference to the entire String, itâ€™s a reference to a portion of the String.

let s = String::from("hello");

let len = s.len();

let slice = &s[0..len];
let slice = &s[..];
//same syntax
